        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Natural disasters, unexpected crises, and urgent humanitarian needs often strike without warning—leaving behind broken homes, distressed communities, and shattered hope. In the face of these hardships, one thing always shines through: <span class="font-semibold text-black">human kindness</span>. At <span class="font-semibold text-green-700">Donate Bangladesh</span>, we’ve seen how even a small act of generosity can create a massive ripple of change.
        </p>
      
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">🚤 Hope After the Floods in Noakhali</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When devastating floods struck <span class="font-medium">Noakhali</span>, hundreds of families lost not only their homes but also their access to clean water, food, and shelter. Emergency rescue teams, with the support of your donations, were able to reach affected areas quickly. Relief boats delivered life-saving supplies, while volunteers distributed food and dry clothing. <span class="font-semibold">Your help gave them hope.</span>
        </p>
      
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">🏥 Healing Communities in Feni</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In <span class="font-medium">Feni</span>, the floodwaters left behind a trail of destruction. With your donations, we provided immediate aid: <span class="italic">clean water, medical supplies, and food packages</span>. These essentials helped prevent disease outbreaks and gave struggling families a moment of relief. Our teams also supported efforts to rebuild schools and shelters, making a long-term impact on these vulnerable communities.
        </p>
      
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">🧕 Support for the Injured in the Quota Movement</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When the <span class="font-medium">Quota Movement</span> turned violent, many peaceful protesters were injured. With your donations, we supplied first aid, medical assistance, and trauma care to victims who had nowhere else to turn. You ensured they were <span class="font-semibold">seen, treated, and respected</span> during a time of national unrest.
        </p>
      
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">💛 Why Every Taka Counts</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Whether it’s <span class="font-semibold">0 BDT</span> or <span class="font-semibold">2400 BDT</span>, every donation matters. At Donate Bangladesh, we believe that kindness is more powerful than money—and <span class="italic">we’ve built this platform so that anyone can contribute, regardless of their financial situation</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          By donating, you're not just giving money. You're <span class="font-semibold">giving someone food, safety, medicine, and hope</span>. You’re showing them that even in the darkest moments, they are not alone.
        </p>
      
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">🙌 Join the Movement</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
